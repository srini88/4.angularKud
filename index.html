<!-- seems like in js there is no associative array....you got to make it as an object.....with or without  quotations on the key elements... -->
<!-- An associative array is simply a set of key value pairs. The value is stored in association with it key and if you provide the key the array will return the value.
For example:
array={key1: 'value1',key2:'value2'};
creates an object called array with two keys and two values which in this case happen to be two constant strings.
Notice that the value stored can be any JavaScript object and in this example it is probably better to think of storing two string objects rather two string literals. 
The key can be either an identifier, a string or a number but more about the difference in the key type as we progress.
You can retrieve a value via it key using array notation:
alert(array['key2']); -->
