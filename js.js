// hey if u remember orderBy ,in previous video ,if we want to order by 'age' we used to give orderBy:age , now here  , searchText.city is dynamically created ,so say we have $scope.searchText.city = 'London' ,thus it means searchText is now a object,not just a variable containing text,it has key:city, so when we apply filter ,it tries to find string according to which it will filter,that it find in key 'city',thus logically filter is applied to city,
// I am just guessing ,I may be wrong.ï»¿
